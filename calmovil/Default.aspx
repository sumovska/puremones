<h1><%=Headline %></h1>
Hemorrhoids are embarrassing. The fact is, most people will get a hemorrhoid flare-up at some point in their life. A painful lump on your butt or the sight of blood is frightening. You panic and ask, "do I have cancer"?<br /><br />
The good news: in most cases it's just a swollen vein - a hemorrhoid. It hurts but is not life threatening. <br><br>
<span class='yellow'><b>Read this site in detail and discover how Mother Nature can help you...</b></span><br/><br/>
We suffer in silence because we're too embarrassed to talk about it. The pain and itching become unbearable given that there are so many sensitive nerve endings around the anal area. You can't focus. After a week of suffering you become physically exhausted and mentally depressed. Women avoid having sex, afraid that their partner will find out about their hemorrhoids.<br /><br />

<%=DynamicHead %>

<h1>What is a Hemorrhoid?</h1><br />
A hemorrhoid is an enlarged vein in the anus (it's also called a varicose vein). In a healthy person, the tissue around the anus fills with blood to regulate bowel movements. However, when there is constant pressure or other factors restricting blood flow, the veins become inflamed. Poor blood flow may cause a blood clot. That results in a painful, swollen, protruding hemorrhoid.<br /> <br />

Physicians classify two types of hemorrhoids:<br>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <strong>External Hemorrhoids</strong> common symptoms are itching and burning. Streaks of blood may appear on toilet paper during bowel movements.<br /><br />
            <strong>Internal Hemorrhoids</strong> common symptoms are rectal bleeding and intense pain. Internal hemorrhoids often protrude and clot. The presence of mucus and blood is also a sign of internal hemorrhoids.<br clear="all" />

<h1>What Causes Hemorrhoid?</h1>

Piles are caused by continuous pressure on the small vein in the anus. Potential causes:<br /><br />
<ul>
    <li>Prolonged sitting or standing</li>
    <li>Constipation and straining at bowel movements</li>
    <li>Frequent Diarrhea</li>
    <li>Excess weight</li>
    <li>Pregnancy and childbirth</li>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Genetics</li>
    <li>Heavy lifting</li>
</ul>


<h1>What Can You do About Hemorrhoids?</h1>

People's first reaction is to buy the infamous well known hemorrhoid cream. Unfortunately, it only temporarily masks the symptoms by shrinking hemorrhoid tissue with a chemical called phenylephrine. It does not treat the cause of hemorrhoids. The hemorrhoids will subside, but return after a few weeks or months with more severe pain and bleeding. Using a cream to mask symptoms but not treating the real source of the problem is the number one reason people end up at the doctor's, needing major treatment or surgery.<br /><br />  


<h1>Hemorrhoid Treatments</h1>
<strong>Rubber band ligation</strong> -  Elastic bands are wrapped around the base of a hemorrhoid to cut off its blood supply. Within several days, the hemorrhoid dies and falls off. Some patients experience pain and bleeding after the treatment. It does not cure the cause of hemorrhoids so they usually reappear.<br /><br />


<strong>Infrared coagulation</strong> - Infrared beam is used to burn off some tissues to cut off the blood supply to the hemorrhoid. Five to six treatments (one per week) are necessary. Although it's advertised as pain-free, many patients complain of intense pain during treatment. It does not cure the cause so the hemorrhoids usually reappear.<br /><br />


<strong>Hemorrhoidectomy</strong> - a surgical procedure that removes the hemorrhoids. Statistics have shown that this treatment may cause incontinence later in life so it is recommended only for severe cases. Many patients complain of intense pain during recovery, so it should be the last resort.<br /><br />
